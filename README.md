# Data Processing Pipeline for Hate Speech Recognition

Process to reproduce:

1. Get `all_comments_lang.csv` from Dropbox. This file is the same as `all_DEFR_comments_27062022.csv`, only with lang labels generated by `langdetect` added as an additional column.
2. Place `all_comments_lang.csv` into folder `data`.
3. Make sure you are running Python 3.11.2 for full reproducibility. The recommended way to manage different Python versions is [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv).
4. Run `bash run-processing.sh`. This should download all the necessary dependencies and run the processing script.
5. Check the `data` folder. It should have the files `processed_comments_{train,evaluation,test}_v*.csv`.

## Making changes

**IMPORTANT:** Whenever you make changes to the code, before running it, bump the `VERSION` variable in `process_data.py` by 1. This ensures that we never accidentally use differently processed data, and prevents data leakage and other problems.
